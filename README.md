This OER is an adaptation of Anna Davis's and Paul Zachlin's Linear Algebra: An Interactive Introduction, 
which was funded by the Ohio Open Ed Collaborative (OOEC) through the Ohio Department of Higher Education Innovation grant.

The scope of this project was to convert their textbook from Ximera/LaTeX to PreTeXt and 
make minor changes to suit the instructional needs of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
