  <title>Overview on linear systems</title>

    <p>
        <alert>Abstract.</alert>
        Our journey through linear algebra begins with linear systems.
    </p>


    <definition>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A <term>linear function in one variable</term> is of the form <m>f(x) = ax+b</m> where <m>x</m> is a variable and <m>a,b</m> are 
                numbers (or <term>scalars</term> as they are referred to in linear algebra). It is <term>homogeneous</term> if <m>b=0</m>. 
                Similarly, a <term>linear function in n variables</term> is one of the form
                <me>
                    f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) = a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots a_nx_n + b
                </me>
                where the <m>x_i</m> are variables (or unknowns) and the <m>a_i</m> are scalars. 
                Again, the linear function is called <term>homogeneous</term> if the constant term <m>b</m> is zero. 
                Next, a <term>linear equation in n variables</term> is one of the form
                <me>
                    a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots a_nx_n =  b
                </me>
                where the expression on the left is a linear homogeneous function in <m>n</m> variables, and the term on the right is a constant.  
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition >

    <example>
        <p>
            Consider
            <me>
                3x_1 - 7x_2 + 11x_3 = 14.
            </me>
            This is a linear equation in three variables: <m>x_1, x_2</m>, and
            <m>x_3</m>. A <term>solution</term> to a linear equation is an assignment of
            values to each of the variables appearing which makes the equation hold true.
        </p>
        <p>
          We see
            <me>
                x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0, x_3 = 1
            </me>
            is a solution to this linear equation, because when substituted into the left-hand side it results in the value <m>14</m>.
        </p>
    </example>

    <definition>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A <term>system of equations</term> is a collection of linear equations in the same set of variables, or unknowns
                <md xml:id="eqn-sys">
                    <mrow>a_{11}x_1 \amp\amp+ a_{12}x_2 \amp\amp + {}\ldots{} \amp\amp + a_{1n}x_n \amp\amp =  b_1 \amp </mrow>
                    <mrow>a_{21}x_1 + \amp\amp a_{22}x_2 + \amp\amp  {}\ldots{} \amp\amp + a_{2n}x_n \amp\amp  = b_2 \amp </mrow>
                    <mrow>\vdots \amp\amp  \vdots \amp\amp  {}\ldots{} \amp\amp  \vdots \amp\amp   \vdots \amp </mrow>
                    <mrow>a_{m1}x_1 \amp\amp+ a_{m2}x_2 \amp\amp + {}\ldots{} \amp\amp + a_{mn}x_n \amp\amp =  b_m \amp </mrow>
                </md>
                and a <term>solution</term> to that system is an assignment of values to the variables which make <term>each equation</term> 
                hold true. The <term>solution set</term> of a system of equations is the collection, or set of all the solutions of that system 
                (which will be empty if the system has no solutions). Given <m>m</m> equations in the same set of <m>n</m> unknowns, 
                the ordered pair of integers <m>(m,n)</m> are referred to as the <term>dimensions</term> of the system, and the system 
                would be referred to as an <term><m>m\times n</m> system of equations</term> (read: <term>m-by-n system of equations</term>), 
                or an <term><m>m\times n</m> system</term> for short.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>


    <example>
        <p>
            Systems of equations, or even a single equation, need not have a solution. To illustrate, consider the equation
            <me>
                0x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3 = 4
            </me>
            Obviously, any set of values substituted into the left-hand side of this equation will produce the value zero, 
            which is not equal to 4. But even non-zero systems might not have a solution. As an example, consider the
            <md>
                <mrow>x_1 \amp\amp - 2x_2 \amp\amp =\amp \phantom{1}7 </mrow>
                <mrow>2x_1 \amp\amp - 4x_2 \amp\amp =\amp 16 </mrow>
            </md>
            The left-hand side of the second equation is twice that of the first. 
            So if we take any solution of the first equation and plug in those values on the left-hand side of the second equation, 
            we will always get <m>2*7 = 14\ne 16</m>. Therefore, these two equations will never be simultaneously satisfied, 
            and so the system doesn't have a solution.
        </p>

    <definition>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A system which has at least one solution is called <term>consistent</term>. 
                If it doesn't have any solutions it is called <term>inconsistent</term>.
            </p>
        </statement>

    <p>
        In the following activities, the main questions we need to answer are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Given a system of equations, does it have one or more solutions (in other words is it consistent)?
            </li>
            <li>
                If it is consistent, what are the solutions?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is there a systematic way of finding the solutions?
            </li>
        </ul>
        The material in the first module is focused on answering these questions.
