    <alert>Abstract.</alert> 
    <em>A linear transformation is a function between vector spaces preserving the structure of the vector spaces.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Suppose <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> are vector spaces (of arbitrary dimension). 
    A <term>function</term> <m>f:V\to W</m> is (as we recall) a rule which associates to each <m>{\bf v}\in V</m> a unique vector <m>f({\bf v})\in W</m>. 
    We will call such a function a <term>linear transformation</term> if it commutes with the linear structure in the domain and range:
  
    <md>
      <mrow>f({\bf v} + {\bf w}) = f({\bf v}) + f({\bf w})\qquad\forall {\bf v,w}\in V</mrow>
      <mrow>f(\alpha{\bf v}) = \alpha f({\bf v})\qquad\qquad\forall \alpha\in\mathbb R, {\bf v}\in V</mrow>
    </md>
    
    In other words, <m>f</m> takes sums to sums and scalar products to scalar products. 
    These two properties can be combined into one, using linear combinations. Precisely, 
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>V,W</m> be vector spaces. A function <m>f:V\to W</m> is a linear transformation if
        <me>
          f(\alpha{\bf v} + \beta{\bf w}) = \alpha f({\bf v}) + \beta f({\bf w})\qquad\forall \alpha,\beta\in\mathbb R, {\bf v}, {\bf w}\in V
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <exercise> 
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that <m>f</m> is a linear transformation iff
        <me>
          f(\alpha_1{\bf v}_1 +\dots \alpha_n{\bf v}_n) = \alpha_1 f({\bf v}_1) +\dots \alpha_n f({\bf v}_n)\qquad\forall \alpha_i\in\mathbb{R}, {\bf v}_i\in V
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  
<p>
  As a consequence of this exercise, we have
</p>

<corollary>
  <p>
    If <m>f: V\to W</m> is a linear transformation, then it is uniquely determined by its values on a basis for <m>V</m>. 
    Conversely, if <m>S := \{{\bf v}_1,\dots {\bf v}_n\}</m> is a basis for <m>V</m> and <m>g:S\to W</m> is a function from the set <m>S</m> to <m>W</m>, 
    then <m>g</m> extends uniquely to a linear transformation <m>f:V\to W</m> with <m>f({\bf v}_i) = g({\bf v}_i), 1\le i\le n</m>. 
    Thus, if <m>f_1, f_2:V\to W</m> are two linear transformations which agree on a basis for <m>V</m>, then <m>f_1 = f_2</m>.
  </p> 
</corollary>

<p>
  Linear transformations may be used to define subspaces. Let <m>L:V\to W</m> be a linear transformation. The <term>kernel</term> of <m>L</m> is then
  <me>
    ker(L) := \{{\bf v}\in V\ |\ L({\bf v}) = {\bf 0}\}\subset V
  </me>
  The <term>image</term> of <m>L</m> is defined as
  <me>
    im(L) := \{ {\bf w}\in W\ |\ \exists {\bf v}\in V \text{ with } L({\bf v}) = {\bf w}\} \subset W
  </me>
  The image of <m>L</m> is sometimes denoted <m>L(V)</m>. It is also referred to as the <term>range</term> of <m>L</m>. 
  These subspaces are useful in defining specific types of linear transformations. We say <m>L:V\to W</m> is

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>surjective</term> or <term>an epimorphism</term> iff <m>im(L) = W</m>; 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>injective</term> or <term>a monomorphism</term> iff <m>ker(L) = \{\bf 0\}</m>;
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>bijective</term> or <term>an isomorphism</term> iff <m>L</m> is both surjective and injective.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  We say that two vector spaces <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> are <term>isomorphic</term> if there exists a linear transformation <m>L:V\to W</m> which is an isomorphism.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-rank-null">
  <p>
    For any linear transformation <m>L:V\to W</m>, <m>ker(L)</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m> and <m>im(L)</m> is a subspace of <m>W</m>. Moreover, 
    <me>
      Dim(V) = Dim(ker(L)) + Dim(im(L))
    </me>
  </p>
</theorem>

<p>
  It is natural to ask: what does it mean for a map to be a linear transformation? 
  For example, if <m>f:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^m</m>, or more generally if <m>f:V\to W</m> satisfies the above property, does it admit some simple description? 
  We investigate this question next.
