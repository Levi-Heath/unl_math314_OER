  <title>Vector spaces of linear transformations</title>

    <p>
        <alert>Abstract.</alert>
        <em> The collection of all linear transformations between given vector
        spaces itself forms a vector space. </em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppose <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are linear transformations from <m>V</m> to <m>W</m>.  Then the function
        <me>
            f + g : V \to W
        </me>
        defined by the rule which sends <m>v \in V</m> to <m>f(v) + g(v)</m> is also a linear transformation.

        Similarly, if <m>f : V \to W</m> is linear and <m>\alpha</m> is a scalar, then the function
        <me>
            \lambda f : V \to W
        </me>
        defined by the rule <m>(\lambda f)(v) = \lambda f(v)</m> is also a linear transformation.
    </p>

    <theorem> 
        <statement>
            <p>
                Suppose <m> V </m> and <m> W </m> are vector spaces.  The collection <m> Lin(V,W) </m> of linear transformations from 
                <m> V </m> to <m> W </m> forms a vector space under the above operations.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
        In fact, using bases we can say something more. If <m>S</m> is a basis for an <m>n</m>-dimensional vector space <m>V</m>, 
        and <m>T</m> a basis for an <m>m</m>-dimensional vector space <m>W</m>, then as we have seen above this data can be used 
        to associate to the linear transformation <m>L:V\to W</m> an <m>m\times n</m> matrix
        <me>
            L\mapsto \phi_{S,T}(L) := {}_T L_S\in \mathbb R^{m\times n}
        </me>
        which is essentially the coordinate representation of <m>L</m> with respect to the pair of bases <m>S,T</m>. 
        It is easily seen that under the above association
        <md>
            <mrow>\amp\phi_{S,T}(L_1 + L_2) = {}_T (L_1)_S + {}_T (L_2)_S</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \phi_{S,T}(\alpha L) = \alpha ({}_T L_S)</mrow>
        </md>
    </p>

    <p>
        In other words,
    </p>
    <theorem>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Given a basis <m>S</m> for an <m>n</m>-dimensional vector space <m>V</m> and a basis <m>T</m> for an <m>m</m>-dimensional 
                vector space <m>W</m>, the map <m>\phi_{S,T}: Lin(V,W)\to \mathbb R^{m\times n}</m> is an isomorphism between the 
                vector space of linear transformations from <m>V</m> to <m>W</m> and the vector space of <m>m\times n</m> matrices 
                with entries in <m>\mathbb R</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>
