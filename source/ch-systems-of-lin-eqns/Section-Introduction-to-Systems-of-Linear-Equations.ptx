    <title>Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations</title>

    <p>
        You are probably familiar with the concept of a <term>system of linear equations</term> and with some methods for solving such systems.  
        In this section, we will look at the algebra and geometry of finding and interpreting solutions of systems of linear equations.  
        We will start with two-variable and three-variable systems, then move on to systems involving more variables.

        <p>
            When you were first introduced to systems of equations, you learned to solve for one variable in terms of the other(s), then substitute.  Here, we will introduce another method.  This alternative method involves adding multiples of one equation to another equation in order to eliminate one of the variables.  This method will form the foundation for an algorithm we will develop for solving linear systems and performing other computations related to systems.  Exploration <xref ref="init-systwoeqs1"/> illustrates how the second method works.

                The purpose of this problem is to formalize what you may already know (perhaps under a different name) about <term>elementary row operations</term> as means of solving systems of linear equations.  Consider the system
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    2x\amp -\amp y\amp=\amp-4\\
                    3x \amp +\amp 2y\amp= \amp 1 
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
                We will begin by adding twice the first row to the second row, and replacing the second row with the sum. 
                <me>
                    R_2+2R_1\rightarrow R_2
                </me>
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    2x\amp -\ampy\amp=\amp-4\\
                    7x \amp +\amp0y\amp= \amp\answer{-7}  
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                Note that this step eliminates <m>y</m> from the second equation.  
        
                Next we divide both sides of the second equation by <m>7</m>. 
                <me>
                    \frac{1}{7}R_2\rightarrow R_2
                </me>
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}

                </me>
        
                
                We now know what <m>x</m> is.  Our next goal is to eliminate <m>x</m> from the first equation.  To this end, we subtract twice the second row from the first row and replace the first row with the difference. 
                <me>
                    R_1-2R_2\rightarrow R_1
                </me>
        
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}

                    x \amp \amp\amp= \amp-1 \\
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
        
                Next we multiply both sides of the first equation by <m>-1</m>. 
                <me>
                    -R_1\rightarrow R_1
                </me>
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    \amp \ampy\amp=\amp2\\
                    x \amp \amp\amp= \amp-1
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                
                    
                Finally, we can switch the order of equations in order to display <m>x</m> in the top row. 
                <me>
                    R_1\leftrightarrow R_2

                    \amp \ampy\amp=\amp2      
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                
                This solution can be written as an ordered pair <m>(-1, 2)</m>.

            As we applied elementary row operations to the system in Exploration <xref ref="init-systwoeqs1"/>, the system changed, but a quick check will convince you that all six systems have the same solution: <m>(-1, 2)</m>.  The six systems are said to be <term>equivalent</term>.  
        </p>

        <p>
            It turns out that if a system of equations is transformed into another system through a sequence of elementary row operations, the new system will be equivalent to the original system, in other words, both systems will have the same solution(s).  We will formalize this statement as Theorem <xref ref="th-elemRowOpsEquivSys"/> at the end of this section.

            <answer>
                <p>
            It may be daunting to think about how to begin.  But keep in mind the desired end-result.  What we want is to use elementary row operations to transform the given system into something like this
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              x \amp \amp\amp\amp\amp= \amp a \\
             \amp \ampy\amp\amp\amp=\amp b\\
             \amp \amp\amp\amp z\amp=\amp c
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
            
        We will accomplish this by using a convenient variable in one row to ``wipe out" this variable from the other two rows.  For example, we can use <m>x</m> in the third equation to wipe out <m>3x</m> in the first equation and <m>2x</m> in the second equation.  To do this, multiply the third row by <m>-3</m> and add it to the top row, then multiply the third row by <m>-2</m> and add it to the second row.  We now have:
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \xrightarrow{R_1-3R_3}\\
         \xrightarrow{R_2-2R_3}\\
        \\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp -\amp13y\amp+\amp7z\amp= \amp-33 \\
             0x\amp -\amp7y\amp+\amp6z\amp=\amp-20\\
             x\amp +\amp4y\amp-\amp2z\amp=\amp11
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
        In the previous step <m>x</m> was a convenient variable to use because the coefficient in front of <m>x</m> was 1.  We no longer have a variable with coefficient 1.  We could create a coefficient of 1 using division, but that would lead to fractions, making computations cumbersome.  Instead, we will subtract twice the second row from the first row. This gives us:
        
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \xrightarrow{R_1-2R_2}\\
         \\
        \\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp+ \ampy\amp-\amp5z\amp= \amp7 \\
             0x\amp -\amp7y\amp+\amp6z\amp=\amp-20\\
             x\amp +\amp4y\amp-\amp2z\amp=\amp11
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
        
        Next we add seven times the first row to the second row, and subtract four times the first row from the third row. 
        
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \\
         \xrightarrow{R_2+7R_1}\\
        \xrightarrow{R_3-4R_1}\\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp +\ampy\amp-\amp5z\amp= \amp7 \\
             0x\amp +\amp0y\amp-\amp29z\amp=\amp29\\
             x\amp +\amp0y\amp+\amp18z\amp=\amp-17
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
            
            Now we divide both sides of the second row by <m>-29</m>.
            
            
        <me>
            
            \begin{array}{c}
            \\
         \xrightarrow{-\frac{1}{29}R_2}\\
        \\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp +\ampy\amp-\amp5z\amp= \amp7 \\
             0x\amp +\amp0y\amp+\ampz\amp=\amp-1\\
             x\amp +\amp0y\amp+\amp18z\amp=\amp-17
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
            
            Adding <m>5</m> times the second row to the first row and subtracting <m>18</m> times the second row from the third row gives us
            
            
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \xrightarrow{R_1+5R_2}\\
         \\
        \xrightarrow{R_3-18R_2}\\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp +\ampy\amp+\amp0z\amp= \amp2 \\
             0x\amp +\amp0y\amp+\ampz\amp=\amp-1\\
             x\amp +\amp0y\amp+\amp0z\amp=\amp1
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
        
        Finally, rearranging the rows gives us
        
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
             x\amp +\amp0y\amp+\amp0z\amp=\amp1\\
             0x \amp +\ampy\amp+\amp0z\amp= \amp2 \\
             0x\amp +\amp0y\amp+\ampz\amp=\amp-1
             \end{array}
        </me>
        
             
         
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
             x\amp \amp\amp\amp\amp=\amp1\\
              \amp \ampy\amp\amp\amp= \amp2 \\
             \amp\amp\amp\ampz\amp=\amp-1
             \end{array}
        </me>
            
             
        Thus the system has a unique solution <m>(1, 2, -1)</m>.
                </p>
            </answer>
        </example>
        
        <p>
        At this point you may be wondering whether it will always be possible to take a system of three equations and three unknowns and use elementary row operations to transform it to a system of the form
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              x \amp \amp\amp\amp\amp= \ampa \\
             \amp \ampy\amp\amp\amp=\ampb\\
             \amp \amp\amp\ampz\amp=\ampc
            \end{array}
        </me>
        The short answer to this question is NO.  The existence of an equivalent system of this form implies that the original system has a unique solution <m>(a, b, c)</m>.  However, it is possible for a system to have no solutions or to have infinitely many solutions.  We will study these different possibilities from an algebraic perspective in subsequent sections.  For now, we will attempt to gain insight into existence and uniqueness of solutions through geometry.

            Unlike the situation in Example <xref ref="ex-systwoeqs2"/>, any combination of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> satisfies the second equation.  So, any ordered pair <m>(x, y)</m> that satisfies the first equation will satisfy the second equation.  Thus, the solution set for this system is the same as the set of all solutions of <m>4x+3y=2</m>.

                Given a linear system in two variables and more than two equations, we have a variety of geometric possibilities.  In terms of the number of solutions, there are three possibilities. 
                
                <ul>

                        First, it is possible for the graphs of all equations in the system to intersect at a single point, giving us a unique solution.

        A <term>linear equation</term> in variables <m>x_1, \ldots, x_n</m> is an equation that can be written in the form
        
        <me>
            a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\ldots +a_nx_n=b

        <p>
            An <m>n</m>-tuple <m>(x_1, x_2,\ldots ,x_n)</m> is a <term>solution</term> to the equation <m>a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\ldots +a_nx_n=b</m> provided that it turns the equation into a true statement.  The set of all <m>n</m>-tuples that are solutions to a given equation is called the <term>graph</term> of the equation. The graph of a linear equation in two variables is a line in <m>\R^2</m>.  The graph of a linear equation in three variables is a plane in <m>\R^3</m>.  In <m>\R^n</m>, for <m>n\gt3</m>, we say that the graph of a linear equation is a <term>hyperplane</term>. A hyperplane cannot be visualized, but we can still talk about intersections of hyperplanes and their other attributes in algebraic terms.

            A linear system of <m>m</m> equations and <m>n</m> unknowns is typically written as follows

            A <term>solution to a system</term> of linear equations in <m>n</m> variables is an <m>n</m>-tuple that satisfies every equation in  the system.  All solutions to a system of equations, taken together, form a <term>solution set</term>.

                    <p>
                Given a system of linear equations, any of the three elementary row operations performed on the system produces an equivalent system.
                    </p>

                <proof>
                    <p> 
                        Clearly, the order of equations does not affect the solution set, so <xref ref="item-rowswap"/> produces an equivalent system.  Next, you learned years ago that multiplying both sides of an equation by a non-zero constant does not change its solution set, which establishes that <xref ref="item-constantmult"/> produces an equivalent system.  To see that <xref ref="item-addrow"/> produces an equivalent system, note that if we add a multiple of an equation to another equation in the system, we are adding the same thing to both sides, which does not change the solution set of that equation, nor of the system.

                    The following figures show a geometric depiction of two equivalent systems.  (The systems are equivalent because they have the same solution set.)  Can the first system be transformed into the second system by elementary row operations?  If so, how?
