  <title>Definition</title>

  <p>
    Suppose <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> are vector spaces (of arbitrary dimension). 
    A <em>function</em> <m>f:V\to W</m> is (as we recall) a rule which associates to each <m>{\bf v}\in V</m> a unique vector <m>f({\bf v})\in W</m>. 
    We will call such a function a <em>linear transformation</em> if it commutes with the linear structure in the domain and range:
  
    <md>
      <mrow>f({\bf v} + {\bf w}) = f({\bf v}) + f({\bf w})\qquad\forall {\bf v,w}\in V</mrow>
      <mrow>f(\alpha{\bf v}) = \alpha f({\bf v})\qquad\qquad\forall \alpha\in\mathbb R, {\bf v}\in V</mrow>
    </md>
    
    In other words, <m>f</m> takes sums to sums and scalar products to scalar products. 
    These two properties can be combined into one, using linear combinations. Precisely, 

    <definition> 
      Let $V,W$ be vector spaces. A function $f:V\to W$ is a linear transformation if
      <me>
        f(\alpha{\bf v} + \beta{\bf w}) = \alpha f({\bf v}) + \beta f({\bf w})\qquad\forall \alpha,\beta\in\mathbb R, {\bf v}, {\bf w}\in V
      </me>
    </definition>
  </p>

  <exercise> 
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that <m>f</m> is a linear transformation iff
        <me>
          f(\alpha_1{\bf v}_1 +\dots \alpha_n{\bf v}_n) = \alpha_1 f({\bf v}_1) +\dots \alpha_n f({\bf v}_n)\qquad\forall \alpha_i\in\mathbb{R}, {\bf v}_i\in V
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  
<p>
  As a consequence of this exercise, we have

  <corollary>
    <p>
      If <m>f: V\to W</m> is a linear transformation, then it is uniquely determined by its values on a basis for <m>V</m>. 
      Conversely, if <m>S := \{{\bf v}_1,\dots {\bf v}_n\}</m> is a basis for <m>V</m> and <m>g:S\to W</m> is a function from the set <m>S</m> to <m>W</m>, 
      then <m>g</m> extends uniquely to a linear transformation <m>f:V\to W</m> with <m>f({\bf v}_i) = g({\bf v}_i), 1\le i\le n</m>. 
      Thus, if <m>f_1, f_2:V\to W</m> are two linear transformations which agree on a basis for <m>V</m>, then <m>f_1 = f_2</m>.
    </p> 
  </corollary>
</p>

<p>
  Linear transformations may be used to define subspaces. Let <m>L:V\to W</m> be a linear transformation. The <em>kernel</em> of <m>L</m> is then
  <me>
    ker(L) := \{{\bf v}\in V\ |\ L({\bf v}) = {\bf 0}\}\subset V
  </me>
  The <em>image</em> of <m>L</m> is defined as
  <me>
    im(L) := \{ {\bf w}\in W\ |\ \exists {\bf v}\in V \text{ with } L({\bf v}) = {\bf w}\} \subset W
  </me>
  The image of <m>L</m> is sometimes denoted <m>L(V)</m>. It is also referred to as the <em>range</em> of <m>L</m>. 
  These subspaces are useful in defining specific types of linear transformations. We say <m>L:V\to W</m> is


  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>surjective</em> or <em>an epimorphism</em> iff <m>im(L) = W</m>; 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>injective</em> or <em>a monomorphism</em> iff <m>ker(L) = \{\bf 0\}</m>;
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>bijective</em> or <em>an isomorphism</em> iff <m>L</m> is both surjective and injective.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  We say that two vector spaces <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> are <em>isomorphic</em> if there exists a linear transformation <m>L:V\to W</m> which is an isomorphism.

  <theorem xml:id="theorem-rank-null">
    <p>
      For any linear transformation <m>L:V\to W</m>, <m>ker(L)</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m> and <m>im(L)</m> is a subspace of <m>W</m>. Moreover, 
      <me>
        Dim(V) = Dim(ker(L)) + Dim(im(L))
      </me>
    </p>
  </theorem>

  It is natural to ask: what does it mean for a map to be a linear transformation? 
  For example, if <m>f:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^m</m>, or more generally if <m>f:V\to W</m> satisfies the above property, does it admit some simple description? 
  We investigate this question next.
